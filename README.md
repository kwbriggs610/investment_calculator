# Investment Calculator App (MVP)

This project implements the first core feature for a broader financial tracking app: an investment calculator inspired by Calculator.net with support for:

- Initial investment
- Recurring contributions (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually)
- Contribution timing (beginning/end of period)
- Multiple compounding methods (including **continuous compounding**)
- Custom investment horizon in years

## Run locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`.
